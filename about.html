                <p>
                    I'm Henrik, an aspiring game programmer of 34 years, studying at Futuregames 
                    and currently doing my internship at Dimfrost Studio.
                    I have previous experience as a software engineer developing in C++. 
                    <br> <br>

                    In addition to my studies I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer, developing AI-driven solutions using mostly Python.
                    I have an academic background in Engineering Physics and naturally a love for physics and math, but also a will to experiment 
                    and get my hands dirty before diving into theory.
                    These skills have served me well in gamedev. 
                    <br> <br>

                    To always prioritize the team and the delivery of the product is something I believe to be important.
                    During projects I make sure to help the team deliver a good product, not to deliver something that is for my own benefit.
                    This mindset have helped me to take ownership of my own work, but more importantly to be confident taking ownership of a whole team's work. 
                    <br><br>
                    
                    In the future I can see myself working in areas that carry a high degree of uncertainty, that are in line with my aptitude for machine learning and physics.
                    For instance, explore the less charted waters of what AI can do for graphics, world building or simply decrease the players' exposure to lag in online shooters!
                    When I'm not studying or working I would describe myself as a van building dog owner who loves outdoor cooking and playing DnD.
